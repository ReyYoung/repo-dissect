# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-13

### Changed

- `checklinks.py` now verifies both commit-pinned permalinks and `path:line` references (file exists at the commit, line range in bounds).
- Bare file names are resolved to their full path when unique in the repository; ambiguous names are reported.
- In GitHub projects, `path:line` references are reported as "not a permalink"; `--fix` rewrites them into permalinks.
- A numbered layer document with zero code references now fails the check instead of passing with "0 links, 0 problems".
- New hint: lines marked ✅ without a line-level code reference are listed for follow-up (does not affect the exit code).
- `checklinks.py` accepts `local` in place of `owner/repo` for local repositories.
- SKILL.md evidence rules: full paths from the repository root, a code reference on every ✅ line, and a passing check requires exit code 0 with references in every layer document.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added

- First public release of the `repo-dissect` skill.
- Layered dissection workflow: profile, business panorama & feature architecture, technical architecture, main-flow tracing, core modules, reuse assessment, selection assessment, requirement-fit matrix, multi-repo comparison.
- Evidence rules (commit-pinned permalinks, ✅ / 🔍 / ❓ markers) and safety rules for untrusted repository content.
- Standard-library-only scripts: environment check, template diagrams (JSON → SVG), permalink checker, single-file HTML report builder.
- Agent-neutral instructions and fallbacks for Codex, Claude Code, Deep Code, DeepSeek Harness and other SKILL.md-compatible agents.
- Offline Mermaid rendering in reports (pre-rendered static SVG, or the bundled Mermaid 11.6.0 library inlined).
- RAGFlow selection-assessment example.
